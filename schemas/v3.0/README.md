# OpenAPI v3 JSON Schema

This directory contains a JSON Schema for OpenAPI v3.

It was generated by [Tim Burks](https://github.com/timburks)
using a tool that scraped the Markdown text of the OpenAPI Specification
and made several semi-automated refinements. This tool is part of the
[gnostic project](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic),
which generates type-safe models of OpenAPI v2 and v3 directly
from their JSON Schemas.

The v3 JSON Schema was significantly reviewed and improved by
[Mike Ralphson](https://github.com/mikeralphson) and
[Tanya Fesenko](https://github.com/tfesenko)
and has been tested with automated schema validators.

The source for this schema is in the [gnostic project](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic) in
[openapi-3.0.json](https://github.com/googleapis/gnostic/blob/master/OpenAPIv3/openapi-3.0.json)
which will also contain the latest revision.
