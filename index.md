# OpenAPI Initiative Specifications and Registries

This site contains the OpenAPI Initiative Specifications, as well as a registry for each way in which those specifications can be extended.

For additional documentation and examples, please visit the [Learn OpenAPI](https://learn.openapis.org/) site.

## OpenAPI Initiative Registry

Each OpenAPI Initiative Specification allows for one or more types of extensions.  There is a registry for each type of extension, plus a registry for draft features being considered for future specification versions.

* [View Registries](./registry/index.html)

Note that implementations are _not_ required to support extensions just because they are in the registry.

## OpenAPI Initiative Specifications

The HTML renderings are the only complete versions of the published specifications, and should be used for formal citations.
